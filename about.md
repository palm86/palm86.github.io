I'm a Djangonaut learning [Phoenix](http://www.phoenixframework.org/), a web framework for the functional language [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/). Most people who rave about Phoenix have a Rails background. And indeed, Ruby has been a great inspiration to Elixir. It turns out that many Phoenix resources put a Rails spin on things. In this blog I am writing about my Phoenix learnings. I compare it to [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), discuss where it is better and where it is still lacking.

The blog is a tribute to one of the best-known tunes of Django Reinhardt, the famous Gypsy jazz guitarist after which the framework Django is named. It runs on Jekyll and its theme is by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

Happy reading!
