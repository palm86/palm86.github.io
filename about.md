I'm a Djangonaut learning [Phoenix](http://www.phoenixframework.org/), a web framework for the functional language [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/). Most people who rave about Phoenix have a Rails background. And indeed, Ruby has been a great inspiration to Elixir. It turns out that many Phoenix resources put a Rails spin on things. In this blog I am writing about my Phoenix learnings. I compare it to Django, discuss where it is better and where it is still lacking.

The blogs runs on Jekyll and its theme was designed by

 Happy reading!
